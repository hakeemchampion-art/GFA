A martial order of monster hunters, craftspeople, and survivalists who believe that the greatest treasures in the world are not gold or relics, but the raw power of nature itself. To them, every beast is a challenge, and every kill an opportunity: hides, fangs, horns, and scales are harvested, refined, and repurposed into weapons, armor, and tools that no ordinary forge could hope to replicate.

Founded by slayers who once battled alongside Cinderviel’s early pioneers, the Guild has since grown into a respected (and feared) institution. Their guildhall resembles more of an armory and workshop than a scholarly hall, its walls lined with trophies of slain creatures, wyvern skulls, hydra fangs, basilisk hides each one a record of victory and sacrifice.

### **Purpose & Role**
The Guild exists to protect the people from monstrous threats while reaping the rewards of the hunt. Their members are trained to track, study, and slay creatures that threaten trade routes, farmlands, or the city itself. Every hunt serves a dual purpose: to safeguard civilization and to supply the materials needed to forge unparalleled arms and armor. Smiths, alchemists, and artisans within the Guild are as revered as the hunters themselves, crafting equipment imbued with the strength and resilience of the beasts that provided them. In this way, the Guild turns monsters into mankind’s greatest weapons.
### **Symbol**
A **dragon’s eye set above a crossed spear and hammer**, representing both the hunt and the crafting of spoils. Guild members often carry carved tokens of this symbol on leather cords.
### **Culture**
The Dragon’s Hoard Hunters Guild thrives on **strength, camaraderie, and respect for the hunt**. Members believe every monster deserves to be faced with courage, and every part of the beast must be used—waste is dishonor. Their guildhall reeks of smoke, steel, and blood, echoing with songs of past hunts and boasting contests about scars. Though they rival the National Adventures Association in fame, their focus is narrower: they do not chase relics or map ruins, only the thrill of the hunt and the trophies it brings.

### **Reputation**
In Cinderviel, the Dragon’s Hoard Hunters Guild stands as the ultimate authority on monsters. Their trophies inspire awe, their weapons turn the tide of battles, and their hunters walk the fine line between civilization’s saviors and its most dangerous predators.

Their greatest rivalry is with the **National Adventurers Association (NAA)**. The NAA views the Hunters as glory-seekers who care little for the broader responsibilities of adventuring, while the Hunters scorn the NAA as scholars and mercenaries who lack the courage to face true monsters head-on. This rivalry is so fierce that it has become legendary in the city of Cinderviel, with heated debates, competitions, and even full-blown clashes breaking out between members of the two organizations. Citizens often find themselves caught in the middle, forced to choose which guild’s philosophy they trust more: the measured, wide-reaching approach of the NAA, or the single-minded, monster-slaying ferocity of the Dragon’s Hoard Hunters Guild.
