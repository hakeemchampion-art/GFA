The **National Adventures Association** is one of the most respected organization in all of Cinderviel and beyond. Founded centuries ago during the city’s early growth, the NAA began as a collective of explorers and mercenaries hired to keep trade routes safe from monsters. Over time, it became something far greater. A structured organization dedicated to tackling public commissions, charting the unknown, and delving into ruins that few others would dare approach.

#### **Purpose & Role**
The Association serves as the bridge between the common people and those bold enough to face peril for coin, glory, or discovery. Farmers may hire the NAA to drive beasts from their lands, merchants might commission protection on dangerous roads, and nobles often post contracts for expeditions into cursed ruins or forgotten forests. Beyond this, the NAA pursues its own ventures, sending adventurers to map uncharted territories, retrieve relics, and document the remnants of fallen civilizations.
#### **Structure**
- **Grey Elk Tavern** – Located in central Cinderviel, a massive guildhall built of stone and timber, decorated with banners of past expeditions. It acts as headquarters, training ground, and meeting place for adventurers.

- **Guild Ranks** – Members rise through ranks based on deeds and reliability: _**Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum,**_ and the near-mythic _**Adamantium**_. Ranks determine the danger of quests one may accept. Your badge also serves as identification and can be used to access the guilds facilities.

- **The Council of Wayfinders** – Veteran adventurers and scholars who oversee the guild’s direction. They assign expeditions, arbitrate disputes, and protect the Association’s reputation. Most notable among of them is Old Man Ienzenwald, the Grey Elk Taverns current guildmaster and a retired _**Adamantium**_ grade adventure.
#### **Culture**
The NAA is known for its mix of camaraderie and rivalry. Its tavern is as much a place of storytelling and boasting as it is for gathering intel. Adventurers from all walks of life pass through its doors. Knights seeking renown, mages hunting forbidden lore, rogues eager for riches, and drifters chasing a purpose in life.
#### **Symbol**
The Association’s emblem is a **compass rose overlaid with a crossed sword and quill**, symbolizing both discovery and conquest.
#### **Reputation**
To the public, the NAA represents both hope and recklessness. The common folk admire them for their courage but whisper that the Association stirs up as much trouble as it solves, unearthing things better left buried. Nobles and merchants, however, see the guild as indispensable for protecting their interests and expanding their reach.
