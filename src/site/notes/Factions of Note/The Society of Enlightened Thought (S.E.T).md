The **Society of Enlightened Thought (SET)** is one of Cinderviel’s most influential organizations, a fellowship of scholars, arcanists, alchemists, and visionaries devoted to pushing the boundaries of magical understanding. Where the NAA delves into ruins to recover relics, the Society strives to **unlock their secrets** to study, replicate, and surpass the ancient works of long-fallen civilizations.

Founded a century ago by a coalition of eccentric wizards and philosophers, the Society has grown into a powerful network of laboratories, libraries, and arcane halls scattered across the globe. Though their discoveries benefit the city; warding magics, public works, and enchanted medicine. Their experiments have also birthed controversy, as their pursuit of knowledge sometimes drifts into the dangerous and the unethical.

#### **Purpose & Role**
The Society of Enlightened Thought exists to unravel the mysteries of magic and bend them toward progress, no matter the risk. Its members dedicate themselves to documenting and dissecting the unknown, whether in the form of dragonfire, divine miracles, or artifacts pried from ancient ruins. They push the limits of spellcraft and enchantment, forging new rituals and inventions that often blur the line between brilliance and danger. Acting as both scholars and custodians, the Society secures powerful relics for study, ensuring such treasures do not fall into reckless hands while quietly reserving the knowledge for their own archives. Beyond research, the Society serves as the city’s foremost authority on arcane matters, advising nobles and the Council alike, and in doing so, shaping policies that can sway the fate of nations as easily as they might a laboratory experiment.
#### **Structure**
- **The Eminarch:** The head of the Society, elected every twenty years. The current Eminarch is **Archmage Caltheris Veylon**, a sharp-eyed, uncompromising wizard who despises misinformation and tolerates no waste of resources. His word is law within the Society.
    
- **The Circles:** Specialized divisions of the Society, each devoted to a different field of study:
    
    - _The Circle of Runes_ – Experts in spellcraft, wards, and sigils.
        
    - _The Circle of Transcendence_ – Focused on pushing the boundaries of mortal potential.
        
    - _The Circle of Origins_ – Dedicated to studying lost civilizations and relics.
        
    - _The Circle of Convergence_ – Scholars of merging magic with the material world—alchemy, artificing, and unstable hybrid experiments.
        
- **The Apprenticeship Tiers:** Students, assistants, and promising spellcasters may earn their way upward by publishing discoveries or proving breakthroughs.
#### **Symbol**
A **stylized open eye set within a circle of runes**, representing both enlightenment and the pursuit of forbidden knowledge. The eye glows faintly on official documents and seals.
#### **Culture**
The Society is a mix of brilliance and arrogance. Its members view themselves as the torchbearers of progress, sometimes dismissing tradition, faith, or caution in the name of discovery. Debate is constant, often fiery, and the halls echo with arguments that could topple empires or explode laboratories. Many members are eccentric, driven, or consumed by their obsessions.
#### **Reputation**
To the common folk, the Society is both a marvel and a menace. Their magical wards protect the city, but their experiments occasionally spill into the streets. For adventurers, the Society is both an employer and a rival, they sponsor expeditions, purchase relics, and hire Pathfinders, but they also hoard secrets and wield political influence to keep competitors in check.
