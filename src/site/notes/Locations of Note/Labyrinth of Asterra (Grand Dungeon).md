At the heart of Cinderviel lies the **Labyrinth of Asterra**, a spiraling dungeon that plunges into the worldâ€™s very core. Its colossal gates of obsidian and rune-marked stone stand ever open, daring the bold to enter. Within, its passage winds downward in an endless coil, each level vast enough to be a world unto itself.

No map has ever held true for long. Each month, as if stirred by some unseen will, the Labyrinth shifts, walls slide, staircases dissolve, and chambers rearrange themselves into new and crueler patterns. Entire wings vanish, only to resurface weeks later in different forms, filled with new dangers and stranger wonders.

Within, adventurers whisper of monsters the size of keeps, rivers of molten crystal, and vaults sealed by spells no mage can unravel. Relics of immense power lie buried in its depths blades that drink souls, tomes inked in starlight, crowns that whisper forgotten truths. Yet none who descended beyond its 18th floor have ever returned to speak of what lies further still.

Cinderviel thrives in its shadow, for the dungeon is both curse and blessing. The brave and the foolish alike flock to its gates in search of glory, riches, or secrets. Few return. Fewer still return unchanged. And deep below, the Labyrinth waits, ever-shifting, as though it hungers for those who dare to challenge it.
