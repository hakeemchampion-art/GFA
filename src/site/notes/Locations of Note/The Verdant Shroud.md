To the south of Cinderviel, where the mountains fall away, the land blooms into a vast jungle known as **the Verdant Shroud**. From afar it looks like a sea of green waves, treetops rising and falling in endless layers, mist curling above them like veils of silk. The canopy is so thick that sunlight rarely reaches the jungle floor, leaving the ruins hidden within cloaked in perpetual twilight.

The Shroud is said to be alive in more ways than one. Vines coil like serpents across shattered temples, and blossoms glow faintly with lingering magic. Whispers drift through the air when the wind moves just right, as though the stones themselves remember the words of the civilizations that built them. Many an adventurer has entered seeking relics of power, and many more have been swallowed whole by the jungle’s silence.

Legends speak of vaults filled with enchanted arms, crystal tomes, and relics untouched by time. Yet just as often, explorers tell of statues that move when unobserved, rivers that shift their course overnight, or trees that bleed light when cut. The Verdant Shroud does not give up its secrets freely it watches, waits, and decides who leaves with treasures… and who never leaves at all.
