Before you rises a mountain unlike any other a colossal, snow-choked volcano that pierces the sky like a spear of stone and ice. Its jagged slopes are draped in endless glaciers, their frozen faces glinting like pale steel under the light. Winds howl across the ridges, carrying with them the hollow roar of shifting ice, a sound some claim is the slumbering breath of the beast beneath. Though the Spire is sheathed in frost, streaks of blackened rock break through the white expanse, and here and there, faint rivulets of molten fire seep from hidden fissures. The lava does not spill freely but glows like the heartbeat of something buried something alive.

Legends in Cinderviel speak of **Veyrath**, the dragon whose fury birthed the mountain itself. They say the wyrm slumbers still, deep within caverns carved by fire and time, his breath keeping the embers alive beneath the icebound shell. Some dismiss it as tavern tale, a warning to children not to wander too far into the wilderness. Others swear they have heard low rumbles in the night no mere tremor of the earth, but the restless stirrings of something vast and ancient.

From the streets of Cinderviel, the Spire is ever visible, a looming presence that watches the city like a sentinel of stone and frost. To the people, it is both a guardian and a curse an awe-inspiring monument whose silence is never fully trusted. For if Veyrath wakes, the mountain will not merely burn again. The world will.
